<div class="container"><h2>THE CONTEXT</h2></div>
<div class="container"><span class="paragraph">

    cAPPellini is a gamification project based on the necessity to create a tool that can lead kids to learn more about the content of the Capellini museum through animated content and a competition-based user interaction.
    <br><br>
    The Capellini Museum is the most ancient geo-paleontological museum in Italy: 
    it was founded in 1860 thanks to the initiative of Giovanni Capellini, who taught geology at the University of Bologna.<br>

    The structure officially opened its doors in 1881 on the occasion of the 2nd International Geological Congress,
     which was attended by scholars and professors from various countries. They contributed to enriching the museum's collection by
      bringing significant artifacts from all over the world, which were donated to the museum once the symposium concluded. <br>
     
    Currently, the collection at the museum bears witness to over five hundred years of educational and scientific research activities, 
    with a heritage of nearly one million preserved specimens housed in the original late 19th-century furnishings. 
    These specimens include rocks, plants, invertebrate and vertebrate fossils. Within the museum's halls, visitors can 
    admire the spectacular skeletons of the proboscidean Mastodon from the Pliocene era, the rich collection of Eocene fish from Monte Bolca,
     Pliocene whales, and the imposing model of the Jurassic Diplodocus dinosaur, measuring twenty-six meters in length and four meters in height. <br> <br>
    
   
    With cAPPellini -  the interactive mobile application that we designed and prototyped - 
     we mean to associate the museum to an educational support that is cost-effective, easily implemented, entertaining and fun to use. <br>

    The app doesn’t need a lot of budget and it doesn’t require the physical purchase of new electronic devices (monitors, VR headsets, tablets,...), 
    according to the bring-your-own-device policy of the experience. Additionally, there are no supervision or maintenance costs, as the users utilize
     their own devices and are completely independent from the staff of the Museum, as they would have been if they visited the museum without using the cAPPellini app.
     <br><br>
    
    The purpose is to increase curiosity on the collection, in schools and families as well, by using the concept of gamification to bring attention to the assets of the museum, with the intention of providing informational content, as well as being entertaining and stimulating.

    <div class="container"><h2>GOALS</h2></div>
    <div class="container"><span class="paragraph"> 

        
        <b>Institutional goals</b>
        <br><br>
        Regarding the institutional goals we specifically focused on attracting new demographics, 
        deciding to target middle school students by insisting on the ways the museum and its collections
         could be perceived as a place for educational activities appreciated by the younger generations. <br><br>
         If reached, this goal should automatically translate itself into an increase in the number of visitors. 
         The project can also target younger audiences if the visit takes place considering a family as a user group. 
         Younger kids can play in single player mode using their parents’ device and help. <br><br>
        We wanted to fulfill the need of giving more explanation and context to the assets of the museum. <br>
        This is done in the video guide path by selecting star assets of the collection and giving them more space and priority over others.
         However, the episodes of the video guide do concentrate on a particular asset/concept but provide contextual information about the other assets as well.<br>
        The other institutional goal we focused on is making the narrative behind the collection in the museum reliant on the figure of Giovanni 
        Capellini and its importance. To do this, we decided to make Capellini himself the protagonist and narrator during the animated episodes of
         the tour of the museum. In the animated episodes, Capellini presents himself and speaks in first person, 
          connecting the assets in the museum to his life and work.<br><br>
        
        <b>Cognitive and emotional goals</b>
        <br><br>
        
        The other crucial aspect of the project is the possibility to provide multimedia tools that are familiar 
        to the visitors and that can make the museal experience more creative and meaningful by helping students to
         learn while having fun. <br><br>
        
        We had to keep in mind that we want to stimulate the users: our desire is to help students understand the great value of paleontology by making them play a game. 
        By introducing the element of gamification, we want to facilitate both the competition and the cooperation: <br><br>
         the students who visit the museum with their teacher will play by themselves but will be considered as a team 
         so that the final points will be added together resulting in  the score of the entire class. 
         Therefore, it's necessary to be a team player but also to aim to win, as the final score is cumulative between the single scores of the class. 
         At the end of the game, the users will be able to visualize the team chart 
         (where the class is positioned relatively to all the other classes that played the game and the single user chart 
         (where the user is positioned relatively to everyone that ever played the game). <br><br>
         If the user is a kid visiting the museum with their family and playing alone or with their parents on a single device,
          the score will be individual and only the single user chart will be visualized.
        By introducing this behavior-reward association, we aspire to keep the users hooked and limit their distraction.
