        <div class="container"><h1>"I Grandi Oggetti"</h1></div>
        <div class="container"><span class="paragraph"> <br> <br> Inspired by the Coen Brothers' masterpiece "The Big Lebowski" and influenced by the extraordinary cinematography 
            of Wes Anderson and David Lynch, "The Great Objects" aims to reinterpret the film's narrative through the perspective of the 
            protagonist objects. <br><br>
            Conceived as a one-of-a-kind trailer, this short film takes us through the story of "The Big Lebowski," 
            exploring its setting through an aesthetic and conceptual investigation. "The Great Objects" is a passionate tribute 
            to two great masters of contemporary cinema, featuring a subtle blend of styles explicitly conveyed through the use of 3D. 
            It draws inspiration from the surreal atmospheres typical of David Lynch and the visual and stylistic dimension of Wes Anderson.
            <br><br>
            The short film was created with Jessica Bugamelli, Laura Martorana, as a final project for the "3D Animation - Technological Skills for the Cinema of the Future" 
            course organized by Demetra Formazione in collaboration with Future Film Festival. <br><br><br><br>

        <div class="container"><span class="paragraph"> <br> <br> I had the honor to contribute to this short film by Davide Di Lorenzo. The short movie was filmed between Italy and Hungary in 2019, for an exam at the Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna.
            Inspired by David Foster Wallace's essay "Consider the Lobster", it investigates existentialism through the habit of eating animals.
            I contributed to this project with hand-drawn digital frame by-frame animations, shown from minute 5.43.
